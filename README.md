# IDS702_FinalProject_CrimesinSF
This analysis investigates factors that influence the clearance rates of crimes across the various Police Districts of San Francisco. The data analyzed contains reports of crime incidents filed daily with the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) since January 1, 2018. The final valid model used is a hierarchical logistic regression model that models crime clearance rates as the response, and Police Districts as the random intercept. The results show that the time of day, if the crime occurred on a weekday or weekend, and the category of crime, have an impact on the crime clearance rates across the police districts. The dataset is updated daily, so the clearance rates used in this analysis might not be exactly accurate.
